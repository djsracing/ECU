##### 23/07/2022

______________
##### General 
-Phasing is the process in which the motor rotates 360 degrees in the CW direction once and we can determine the feedback offset angle
-4 12V batteries in series connection were used to provide 48V(high voltage) to do the phasing process. 
-RFE and RUN signal were given to the motorcontroller by attaching external push buttons

Steps:
1. Check that the switch in branch K4(discharge relay) is closed and has been closed for **at least 15 seconds**, once it has been closed for 15 sec, open the switch 

2. Changes in the N-Drive software (installation guide attached in the end)
    -  Set Speed 2 at Pos-Reference to 100 
    -  Set Inom eff in settings to 20A
    -  Set Mpole in settings to 20
    -  Set FB pole in settings to 2
    -  Set Mtemp to 32767(to resolve the motor temp issue value, for actual working the value must be set in between 14500-15000 which refers to 90-100 degree celcius)
    -  Set Imax pk to 3%
3. Give the RFE signal {It is mentioned in one of the emails that this can be done before applying the HV }
4. Close the switch in K3(negative AIR)
5. To initial Pre-Charge, close the switch in branch K2(Precharge relay)
6. Using the N-Drive Software determine when the DC-BUS is at least 90% of the total applied voltage (Check NDrive->Extra->Vdc-Bus (0xeb).
7. Once the DC-BUS voltage is **at least 90%** , close the switch in branch K1(Positive AIR) [It was not charged exactly to 90% but was actually showing around 50-51V even though the supply was only 48V]
8. Once the switch in branch K1(positive AIR) has been closed, open the switch in branch K2(Precharge)
9. **High voltage is now being supplied to the motor controller and the system is considered live and should be handled carefully and cautiously 
10.  Changes in N-Drive software
     - Auto ~> Special functions ~> select [fn4] Phasing-Rotating
     - Press START (**The next step must be done before 10 s are over) 
     -  Switch on X1-G (RUN: Run enable)
11. The motor must then rotate 360Â° once in CW direction. 
12. Disable drive by switching X1-G  (RUN) to off (NDrive will tell you) [ Please always deactivate the inverter with the RUN signal before cutting the HV voltage. Even at 48V.The RFE does not need to be disconnected. Disconnecting the RUN input is enough.]

### Issues Faced
1. As seen in the EMRAX-RS_V2 Resolver connector pdf , the wire in the 6th pin of the Feedback plug motor is black-white but no black-white wire is there [Resolved(1)]
2. After completing phasing, the N-drive software is supposed to give back the offset angle of our motor, but it gives a garbage value/whatever value you manually set in it
3. As mentioned in the initialisation guide the motor is supposed to run during phasing at an Imax pk value of 5% it should draw a current of 2-3A {mentioned in emails by edward} however at 5% it draws 21.2A {as shown in phasing videos} and motor does not run at 5%[Resolved(3)]

	   




### Issues Resolved
1. There were translation issues and the wire is supposed to be yellow-white
2. We have custom made the connector ourselves by soldering the resistor as well as the connections
3. We set the Imax pk value to 3% during our successfull test and the current drawn was 12.7A(as shown in N-drive software)



### Circuit Used
1. The normal connections for battery pack(High voltage) connections are replaced by an external battery pack of 4 12V EXIDE batteries kept in series 
2. The controlling of the positive AIR which originally is done by a signal from the MASTER PCB(once 90% charging is done of the motor controller capacitor) was replaced by and external push button 

### Motor Controller connections
1. The RS232 serial interface requires a connector from M8 to D9-S. We have custom made the connector by soldering the wires into the RS232 connector.Special drivers are also required to be installed
2. The resolver connections are as follow
